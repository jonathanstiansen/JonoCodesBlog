                <p>should both think more positively of being a technical manager, but also should
change how we do management. I believe that fewer managers, are required - and
we can accomplish this by training, and empowering the 'lower level' employees
to make good business decisions.</p>
<h2>Opinion: Truth and Consequences of the Technical Track</h2>
<p>First I'm going to summarize this blog post:
http://whilefalse.blogspot.ca/2015/11/truth-and-consequences-of-technical.html
from a CTO named Camille. It's a response to a post from <a href="http://mcfunley.com/thoughts-on-the-technical-track">Dan
McKinnely</a>. I'll give a
short summary of the main points. Then I will give my opinion on these two great
articles (which I disagree with). I'll use both Camille's and Dan's names in the
post.</p>
<h3>Camille's post</h3>
<p>Camilles trying to make tech employees appreciate management more. That's noble,
and important. Managers should be appreciated, their job can be important and
difficult. She values management in tech and wants to show that they too makes
sacrifices for their job. A big assumption the author makes: companies need tree
like management structures to run. The higher positions make broader decisions,
thus you need levels of management. She feels as a great engineer, she has only
the impact of one. When you're a great manager you not limited by this. She felt
that becoming a manager was necessary "in order to have the broader ability to
focus people on projects where I felt their impact would make more difference on
the company."</p>
<p>She mentions people who don't want to do management shouldn't get promoted. Both
articles agree on this. At some point she thinks we are giving undeserved raises
to tech employees. These employees don't give enough value to the company. Both
managers and tech workers should have to prove that they are increasing their
area of value. Not by a constant, but by a multiplier (my words). 
Camille makes an interesting point. All companies should be promoting those who
create business value.</p>
<p>Protip: <a href="http://www.leanblog.org/2013/02/toyota-respect-for-people-or-humanity-and-lean/">money isn't the only value in a
business</a>)
and <a href="http://istechameritocracy.com/">tech isn't a meritocracy</a>).</p>
<h3>Dan's point</h3>
<p>Dan believes promoting somone to management should take a lot of thought. Make
sure the promotee thinks hard too. He doesn't believe the current level of
management overhead is good or benefitial. 
Dan makes a crucial point. Given one a senior manager and one a senior dev who
make roughly the same, developers get no <em>super powers</em>. Managers can hire,
fire, make meetings, cancel meetings, choose what gets worked on, etc.
Developers often only get to choose what and how they themselves work.
Developers having a small silo of influence can cause developers to become
nihilistic. Footnote:  <strong>feeling their life and decisions hs little meaning
;-)</strong></p>
<h3>My Opinion</h3>
<p>I believe that companies do <em>not</em> need a top down decision making approach. It's
possible to give a lot of decision making power to the people who know best.
These are often not people high up on the management ladder, instead they are at
the bottom. There is a way to give engineers more impact and reduce the number
of managers. You can trust the employees to make good decisions and let them be
a big part of the decision making process.</p>
<p>"What if the employees make a bad decision?" Two options.</p>
<p>Accept the risk, after all <a href="http://calleam.com/WTPF/?page_id=1445">managers must make a lot of bad decisions
too</a>.
Mitigate the risk, train your employees better. Get them more involved with the
business, that doesn't mean they have to change roles.  <a href="http://www.thehayesgroupintl.com/abbalamo.pdf">Here's an
anecdote</a></p>
<p>As a tech worker autonomy might equal your ability to achieve managements
business goals. Generally you are only given autonomy while you are producing
company value. I agree with this to a certain extend. Company value trumps most
else. Camille doesn't say why this changes with becoming management. I think
    it's exactly the same - you're always accontable to someone.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>A manager in a traditional company should &#39;run interference&#39; for their
employees. This enables employees to do work they see as valuable to the
business. Further, if a manager see it&#39;s good for the engineer that&#39;s also
good for the company. I believe a company is their employees.

Managers of technical teams should first be developers, ops people, or
**fill in the blank**. In other words I think managers should all understand
how difficult good programming is. Neither of the authors would dispute
this but it&#39;s important.  I think it&#39;s important for managers to contribute
occasional code. The Anti-fragile author, Talib Nassim believes that to make
economic predictions you have to be invested in them. His term is **&quot;having
skin in the game&quot;**. This holds for software architects (especially),
managers, maybe even CTO&#39;s (I can&#39;t say).

We don&#39;t trust our employees to give good business input in their area of
expertise. That might be because they don&#39;t understand the business, or
aren&#39;t prepared to. If thats currently the industry, this management
discussion is *NOT* our biggest problem. Our *biggest problem is that we
aren&#39;t investing, trusting, and empowering our employees.*
